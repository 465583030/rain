# Rain server binaries

**Rain** is an open-source distributed computational framework for processing
of large-scale task-based pipelines.

Rain aims to lower the entry barrier to the world of distributed computing. Our
intention is to provide a light yet robust distributed framework that features
an intuitive Python API, straightforward installation and deployment with
insightful monitoring on top.
